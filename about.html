      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>Elton Jili is a born and bred Durbanite. In his free time Elton will likely be found outdoors hiking up a mountain or going on<br> a camping Trip.
	      Elton has been in the photography industry for over 2 years and has a variety of experience in different <br> fields.
	      I am seemingly ‘unflappable’ in stressful situation and always manages to capture great moments. His calm, fun nature <br>lends itself perfectly to putting all clients at ease. Elton specialises in capturing ‘real life’ moments as they happen and fades into <br> the background of functions as much as possible.</p>
